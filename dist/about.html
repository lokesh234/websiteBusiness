            <h3> Computer Science & Engineering</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Started to learn the basics of computer science and engineering starting with making basic HTML Markups for the school. Took classes in computer science for HTML/XML, but the school did not offer any classes in CSS/Bootstrap/PHP. So started learning all the necessary stuff on my own and build a PHP Web Scraper in CSS/HTML/BootStrap/PHP/JavaScript along with taking classes in Engineering Design. Prototyped various types of Designs using CAD and build a keen aptitude for computer science as well as CAD. </p>
          </li>
          <li class="event" data-date="Freshmen-Year College">
            <h3> Introduction to Robotics Engineering and Higher-Level Programming</h3>
            <br>
            <p> Took all the necessary classes as a college freshmen learning Physics, Calculus, Probability and all basic skills necessary for an engineer. In the second semester took classes in Racket, Java and was introduced to higher level programming with learning how to create objects, classes, managing data in BST, AVL Trees. Took the introduction to robotics class and learned a lot by making robots and programming them in embedded C/C++. Created objects/classes in the emedded environment and saw their functionality on my robot.</p>    
          </li>
          <li class="event" data-date="Freshmen-Year Summer">
            <h3> AQI India </h3>
            <br>
             <p> Worked as an Embedded and Full Stack Mean Developer for AQI India. Starting out developing firmware for the companies's sensors in C/C++ under the guidance of an Embedded Systems Engineer. Wrote Algorithms to send the data from the sensors to the company's server. Managed the Date using MongoDB/SQL and PHP and made algorithms for data handling with arrays, objects, binary search trees. Used frameworks such as .NET, AWS and many more. Helped and marketed the sensors through presentations, videos.</p>

            <h3> Robotics Engineering and Computer Aided Design</h3>
            <br> 
            <p> Took a lot of major related classes and started learning the fundamentals of robotics while teaching myself various javascript frameworks. Learning different web-development environments and integrating them into Robotics Engineering. Learned various methods of prototyping robots/parts such as learning SolidWorks and making 3D printed designs for Robots and Mechanical Engineering. Build and programmed various robots that can fight fire, sort objects based on color and size, pick up 3 lbs. Build a purely Mechanical System for the people with muscle atrophy using pulleys and cables. </p>

              <h3> Denavit-Hartenberg Convention Website</h3>
              <br>
              <p>  Currently building a website with integrated CAD that can automate the process assigning DH parameters in Robots using the JavaScript framework Three.js for the CAD part of the website. This website will allow people with minimal to no knowledge of Robotics to build and code their own industrial arm robots.   </p>
